    <p> Career Goals 
    </p>
    <p> My personal career goals are to become an engineer of some sort. At the moment I am not quite sure of what type of engineering I will go into but I will figure it out. I plan to achieve this goal by first trying to excel in math and science in highschool and then to do various PLTW courses involving engineering to get a good head start. Then onto college which I have not picked yet, I will try to go get an education in the field of engineering I prefer. This is my goal and career choice because I like being able to make things with pieces and components, I enjoy STEM subjects overall. I have been very good at some PLTW courses involving engineering already and seemed to enjoy rather than disliking them and their workload.

    <p> Personal Achievements and Experiences
    </p>
    <p>So far I have had great experience with some of the engineering classes I have done. I am not as good at letting any teammates I work with help out on projects, because usually I am the one with the ambitious ideas. I am a creative person, only when it comes to being assigned a specific task will I be able to make a good solution in relation to my engineering planning skills. Otherwise if I am asked to make something a little bit more random, I will not be as good at completing that project. Overall I am persistent when it comes to getting the job done.
    </p>
    <p>I have yet to complete the rest of high school, so not too many achievements yet! Now for some abilities, so far I have learned that I am good at working in small groups. I am usually a slow learner when trying to grasp a new concept at first, but usually once I get more familiar with it, I am faster than most others. I learned this from most of my math classes, whenever we learned something important and new, I would always be asking my tablemates questions about it. But then comes the next day and somehow I understand more than my tablemates do. So far the most difficult class I have taken thus far in terms of thinking is probably computer science. I thought I would be both good at engineering and coding but apparently I am a better engineer than coder. I still am going to try to get a little bit of experience in computer science before moving onto engineering just to be safe.
